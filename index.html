    <h3> About the movie </h3> 
    <img src="The art of racing in the rain.jpg">
    <p>In death basket flashbacks, doting golden retriever Enzo tells his wonderful life with devoted owner Denny, a talented aspiring Formula One race car driver, who put his racing dream back to marry Eve and raise their daughter Zoe. Only after Eve dies in a tragic accident and a bitter custody case against Denny by her rich parents, he accepts a test driver job in Ferrari's Milan HQ. By then, inseparable Enzo is so sick he can only enjoy a first and last ride in Denny's stat of the art F1 car, confident he'll be reborn as a budding racer, as apparently happens eight years later.</p>

    <h3> A Quote from the movie </h3> 
    <p>Enzo: He picked me out of a pile of pups, a tangled mass of paws and tails. He'd stopped at the farm on his way home from the speedway at Yakima. Even back then, I knew I was different than other dogs. My soul just felt more human.</p>
